This is the code for my blog, the first website I ever wrote. I've become 
interested in cleaning it up and making it more professional recently, and 
thought I would make my progress public. You are sure to find bugs, 
anti-patterns, code smells, and basic nonsense here for some time to come. If 
you care enough to point out my flaws, feel free to open an issue.
